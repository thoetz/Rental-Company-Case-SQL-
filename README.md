- **Data Filtering**: Applying `WHERE` clauses to filter data based on specified conditions.
- **Sorting**: Ordering results using `ORDER BY` to arrange data in ascending or descending order.
- **Data Limiting**: Limiting the number of returned rows with `LIMIT`.
- **Data Modification**: Using `DISTINCT` to retrieve unique records and modifying data with `CONCAT()` function.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data integrity by enforcing relational constraints through foreign key relationships.
